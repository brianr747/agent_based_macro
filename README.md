Simple Agent-Based Macro Model

This is extremely preliminary. I am putting this up here to give me a backup.

Note that this project by itself is just core simulation classes, and they are not tied together
into a simulation. That is being done in the separate "spacetrader" project. As such, this project
by itself is going to be hard to figure out.

Will fill in more details if this works...
