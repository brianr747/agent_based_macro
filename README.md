Simple Agent-Based Macro Model

This is extremely preliminary. I am putting this up here to give myself a backup.

There are design notes in the project file, but they are somewhwat rambling theorycrafting
for my own purposes. It is possible that I will drop working on this project, and those
notes are to allow me to get back into the design.

Note that this project by itself is just core simulation classes, and they are not tied together
into a simulation. That is being done in the separate "spacetrader" project. 

Go to the "spacetrader" project to see an example of how a simulation is tied together.
If I get it to work, the simulation part might migrate back into this project so that
this project makes sense as a stand-alone entity. 

Will fill in more details if this works...
